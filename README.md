# Automated Website CI/CD Pipeline - GitHub, Jenkins, Ansible & Docker

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a website. The pipeline is built using Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and AWS services, with GitHub serving as the central repository for code management. The infrastructure is configured on AWS EC2 instances to ensure a seamless workflow from code changes to deployment.

## Features
- **Version Control**: GitHub is used to store and manage the project's source code.
- **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins automates building and testing the code after each commit.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible is used to configure servers and deploy the application.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS EC2 instances host the application and associated services.
- **Automation**: The pipeline ensures end-to-end automation from code push to deployment.

## Pipeline Workflow
1. **Code Push**: Developers push code to the GitHub repository.
2. **Jenkins Build**:
   - Pulls the latest code from GitHub.
   - Builds the Docker image for the application.
3. **Ansible Deployment**:
   - Configures AWS EC2 instances.
   - Deploys the application Docker container to the instances.
4. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Automated testing ensures quality.
   - Successful builds are deployed to production.

## Prerequisites
- **GitHub Repository**: Source code is stored and versioned.
- **Jenkins**: Installed and configured for CI/CD tasks.
- **Ansible**: Installed on the Jenkins server for remote configuration.
- **Docker**: Installed on the target servers for containerized deployment.
- **AWS Account**: EC2 instances configured for infrastructure hosting.

- **AWS Account**: EC2 instances configured for infrastructure hosting.

2. Set Up Jenkins
Install the required plugins: Git, Ansible, Docker, etc.
Create a Jenkins pipeline job and configure it to use the repository.
3. Configure Ansible
Install Ansible on the Jenkins server:

*sudo apt update

*sudo apt install ansible -y


Update the inventory file with AWS EC2 instance details.
Define playbooks for configuring and deploying the application.

4. Set Up Docker
Install Docker on the target EC2 instances:

*sudo apt update

*sudo apt install docker.io -y

5. AWS Configuration
Create and launch EC2 instances for the pipeline.
Configure security groups, IAM roles, and key pairs for access.

Usage
Push your code changes to the GitHub repository.
Jenkins automatically triggers the pipeline:
Builds the Docker image.
Deploys the application using Ansible.
The application is accessible on the public IP of the EC2 instance.
